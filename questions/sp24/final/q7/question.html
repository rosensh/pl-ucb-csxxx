        Implement <code>swap</code>, which takes a <code>Tree</code> instance <code>t</code> with unique node labels and two different values <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> that are labels of <code>t</code>. It mutates the tree by placing the node labeled <code>x</code> in the position of the node labeled <code>y</code>, and the node labeled <code>y</code> in the position of the node labeled <code>x</code>.
    </p>
    <pre>
Hint: The built-in <code>exec</code> function takes a string and executes the Python statement it contains in the current environment. For example:
>>> exec('x = 1 + 1')
>>> x
2

There are two blanks in <code>swap</code>, but they both contain exactly the same code, so you just need to write that code once.

def find(t, x, s, f):
    result = []
    def g(t, s):
        if t.label == x:
            result.append(s)
        for i in range(len(t.branches)):
            g(t.branches[i], s + f(i))
    g(t, s)
    assert len(result) == 1, 'x should appear as a label exactly once'
    return result[0]

def swap(t, x, y):
    """Swap the positions of the nodes labeled x and y in Tree t.
    >>> n = Tree(1, [Tree(2, [Tree(3, [Tree(4)]), Tree(5)]), Tree(6, [Tree(7)])])
    >>> b = n.branches[0].branches[0]
    >>> b is n.branches[1]
    False
    >>> swap(n, 3, 6)
    >>> n
    Tree(1, [Tree(2, [Tree(6, [Tree(7)]), Tree(5)]), Tree(3, [Tree(4)])])
    >>> b is n.branches[1]
    True
    """
    px = find(t, x, _______ )
    py = find(t, y, _______ )
    exec(px + ',' + py + '=' + py + ',' + px)

            (a) Write the code that fills in both blanks. (The same code fills in each blank.) The <code>find</code> function takes four arguments, so your answer should contain two expressions separated by a comma.
